Using VBA for Stock Analysis

In this project we are using VBA to help us analyze the stocks we are given. There are 12 different tickers and over 3,000 rows of data. Our goal is to look at each ticker and see the total volume and return that they are getting in each year since we have two sheets from two different years. In module 2 we completed most of this work, we compiled a code that made it easy for Steve to look into the spread sheet, click a button and See the total Volume and total return but now our goal is to refractor the code so that it is more efficent but can also hold more tickers if necessary.
